This repository contains two separate Python scripts developed as part of the **"Network Traffic Optimization"** course project. These scripts demonstrate various network analysis and optimization techniques.  

### Prerequisites  
To run these scripts, you will need to have the following installed:  
1. **Python** (version 3.8 or later)  
2. The following Python libraries:
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scipy` 

You can install the required libraries using:  
```bash
pip install -r <libraries names>
```  

Each script is self-contained, so you can execute them independently based on the specific functionality you wish to explore. Detailed instructions for running each script can be found in the respective script comments or README file.
